        "Ever since I was young, I‚Äôve been curious about how people interact with technology and the world around them. This curiosity led me to explore design‚Äînot just how things look, but how they work. With a background in coding and a Master of Interaction Design from the University of Queensland, I‚Äôve built a foundation that bridges creative design and functional development. I enjoy creating experiences that are both meaningful and technically thoughtful.",

        "My design philosophy is shaped by a deep respect for simplicity and usability. In a world where people interact with countless digital products every day, I aim to reduce cognitive load and create experiences that feel welcoming and intuitive.\n\nWith a background in coding, I don't just focus on making things look good or improving the user experience ‚Äî I also ensure that my designs are technically feasible. I understand how challenging it can be for engineers to implement overly complex or impractical UI. That's why I strive to design interfaces that balance visual appeal with development efficiency, making collaboration with software engineers smoother and more effective.\n\nI‚Äôm passionate about the small things ‚Äî thoughtful micro-interactions, the perfect spring animation, or a playful motion that brings a smile. These subtle details can have a huge impact, shaping how people feel while using a product.\n\nAt the heart of everything I do is empathy. I never forget that there's a real person on the other side of the screen, and I design with the goal of making their experience not only functional, but meaningful and fulfilling.",

When I'm not designing, you‚Äôll probably find me out riding my bike or playing tennis üéæ on the court, enjoying the rhythm of movement and the challenges it brings me.",
